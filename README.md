## Analysis - Chicago_Speed_Enforcement_Program

Childrenâ€™s Safety Zone Program, initiated by Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) is a key initiative to ensure safety for children and pedestrians around schools and parks. It forces vehicles to slow down and obey speed laws around safety zones designated as a 1/8th of a mile boundary around any Chicago parks or schools.

With the help of automated safety cameras, speeding vehiles  are identified who are breaking the law by exceeding the speed limits and issued a speeding ticket as per the following rules specified under the program:
- The enforcement hours will be limited from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in safety zones around schools on school days (Monday-Friday).
- The enforcement hours around parks will be limited to only those hours parks are open (typically 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., 7 days a week) with a 30 mph speed limit.
- The City is capping the locations where speed cameras can be installed to 20% of the 1,500 safety zone locations allowed by state law (approximately 300).
- Camera locations are chosen based on available data regarding traffic, speeding, and crashes.

The first cameras were installed in the year 2013 and since then it has been effective in reducing the number of violations significantly around the schools and parks. However, in order to make it even better, it is important to lookback on the program performance and take any corrective timely measures, if needed. 

Therefore, to do so, we studied the speed violations data captured for these cameras and observed that there has been a significant drop in the number of violations between 2014-2019. However, to uncover deeper insights, we looked at the data from different perspectives.

**No. Of Violations Over The Years**
In order to study the variation in number of violations over the years, we filtered the data as per safety zone categories - 'Parks' & 'Schools'. Then, we studied the variation for each camera location and also for each category separately. We did that in the following way:

Camera-Zonewise-Distribution:
Data Source: 
Chart Type: Heat Map, which divided the camera locations between two categories - 'Parks' & 'Schools'.
Marks:
- Title: A brief title for the graph was added to introduce the purpose of the graph to a reader. 
- Color: Distinct count of cameras for each category, where Orange - 'Parks' & Blue - 'Schools'.
- Size: Distinct count of cameras for each category, with both boxes of equal size since distribution of cameras in each category was almost equal.
- Label: Zone category was added as a label in order to signify each category. Also, distinct count of cameras for each box was used as a label to indicate the number of cameras each category. These labels were customized to a font size of '11', bold and 'Top Center' aligned for a better presentation.
- Filter: A filter was added which will be used in the following graphs for connection and insight generation.
- Caption: It includes a unique observation from the graph and the links for the data sources.
